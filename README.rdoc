= Hurricane: a simple WordPress eXtended RSS file parser

Hurricane is a tiny tool to parser WordPress eXtended RSS file.

== Example

@blog = Hurricane.from(FILE)

== Features

Few (really!) features. Just what I needed until this moment:

* Blog title
* Blog link
* Blog description
* Blog creation date
* Blog categories
* Posts titles
* Posts links
* Posts creation dates
* Posts descriptions
